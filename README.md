# Minerva
`Minerva` is the Roman goddess of **wisdom** and also a very powerful tool for everyday use. Minerva consists of multiple modules and I hope you will find something useful for yourself.

# Functionality
So far goddess can do:

- Nothing…..

But Jupiter (Minerva's father) is working very hard alongside [@Spnya](https://spnya.com) to improve her and implement new functions.

# Deployment and usage
You can check her out on [Spnya’s site](https://spnya.com) or by deploying her yourself. 

They say that it is unfair to have more than one goddess of wisdom. I say it is about time everybody has one.

- First you have to have [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.
- Then you want to create `.env` file and copy insides of `example.env` to it. 
- Specify things like `DOMAIN`, `TG_TOKEN`, etc.
- Put your ssl certificate in `/ssl` folder
- Start up the Minerva by using
```
sudo docker-compose up --build -d
```
> Note that it will ran in dev mode by default.
